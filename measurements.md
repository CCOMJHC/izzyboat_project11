# UNH CCOM EchoBoat 160 measurements

The GPS reports distance realtive to the mounting point of the aft antenna, which is about 2 centimeters below the bottom of the antenna.

Initial URDF config will set that as base_link.

The top mounting bar is 177 cm long by 7 cm wide. Aft gps is about 2.5 cm from aft end of bar. Fwd gps is about 9 cm from front of bar.

Forward camera imaging reference point is approximately 5.5 cm forward of bar and 5.5 cm below bar.
